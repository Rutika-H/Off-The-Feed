# OFF THE FEED

## Description
So i've logged out of  Instagram for atleast a month now,and obviously i was bored to oblivion at first....but i found out reading books and watching some series or playing games isn't all that bad,so initially my idea was to build a one stop solution for the boredom.Like imdb helps you choosing a movies,this will help you choose,a movie,a book,a game or some random act.I have not  added page for games and books yet,as the layout is similar to movies page,and due to time constraints.but those pages will be up for use in some days and it will be connected to api for diverse options to choose between.

Pages:<br/>
Home   :  My intro,clickable link to follow me on instagram<br/>

Movies : </> Bunch of movies<br/>
         </> Title of the movie takes you to the respective imdb page<br/>
         </> You can mark it by clicking on heart in top right corner<br/>
         </> Color of the movie title changes to white on visiting,hover will be green<br/>

Others :  Static page<br/>

Favorites: Static page again<br/>
