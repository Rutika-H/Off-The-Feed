# React + Vite
I used React framework with vite to work on this project
# Project Name
OFF THE FEED

## Description
So i've logged out of  Instagram for atleast a month now,and obviously i was bored to oblivion at first....but i found out reading books and watching some series or playing games isn't all that bad,so initially my idea was to build a one stop solution for the boredom.Like imdb helps you choosing a movies,this will help you choose,a movie,a book,a game or some random act.I have not  added page for games and books yet,as the layout is similar to movies page,and due to time constraints,also this website is to present myself with my skills...so redundancy wasn't going to help.but those pages will be up for use in some days and it will be connected to api for diverse options to choose between.

Pages:
Home :My intro,clickable link to follow me on instagram

Movies :Bunch of movies,title of the movie takes you to the respective imdb page,you can mark it by clicking on heart in top right,color of link changes to white on visiting,hover will be green

others:static page

favorites:static page again

## setUp

3.It will open in http://localhost:5173/ this local server,
